### **📌 Project: MultiLang-CodeHub**  

#### **📖 About the Project**  
MultiLang-CodeHub is a **sample solution** for a **Programming Course 2 (PK2)** practicum at **Fachhochschule Dortmund**, designed to enhance programming skills through practical tasks. The project covers essential concepts in **procedural programming, object-oriented programming**, and **memory management** using **C**, **C++**, and **C#**.  

The repository features clean, well-structured code for various problem sets, demonstrating the application of these languages in real-world scenarios. It serves as a learning tool to help students understand the differences, strengths, and appropriate use cases for each language.  

#### **🚀 Key Features**  
- **C Programming** – Covers procedural programming and memory management concepts.  
- **C++ Programming** – Focuses on object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and data structures.  
- **C# Programming** – Demonstrates modern software design practices in an object-oriented environment.  
- **Structured Code** – Adheres to best practices and proper code organization.  
- **Cross-Language Comparisons** – Highlights distinctions and similarities between the languages.  

#### **🛠️ Technologies Used**  
- **C**, **C++**, **C#** – Core programming languages  
- **IDE** – Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, or any C/C++/C# supported IDE  

#### **🎯 Goal**  
This repository aims to serve as a comprehensive learning resource for students, helping them strengthen their understanding of programming fundamentals through hands-on examples and multi-language implementations.
