This repository contains the sample solution for the practicum in the course Programming Course 2 (PK2) for the 3rd semester at Fachhochschule Dortmund. The practicum focuses on developing programming skills using C, C++, and C#, covering key concepts such as procedural programming, object-oriented programming, memory management, and software design.

The solution demonstrates practical implementations for a variety of tasks using the different programming languages, providing clean, structured code that adheres to the practicum requirements. It helps students understand the distinctions and strengths of each language and apply them to different problem sets.
